# Authentication

Authentication is the act of verifying whether the user are who they say they are, and it plays a large role in modern society since people are required to have access to specific services and data. Be it through their employment or in their private life. Employee's are often tasked with managing or performing tasks within closed IT systems connected to the company. And because of the sensitive nature and also the fragility of IT systems it is important, that only authorized staff are able to access it. This is why authentication of users are essential for modern IT systems. Because a single malicious user with administrative privileges can destroy or greatly incapacitate IT systems. 

But authentication is also very important for our personal security, because we harbour personal devices as well as personal accounts with sensitive information. A malicious user with access could therefore steal the information, and in the case of social media even masquerade as the person who owns the account. 

Presently, authentication is primarily done through the traditional pairing of usernames and passwords. To ensure the security of each account the users are routinely expected to change their passwords, however, users often keep the same password across different services. Furthermore, these passwords should be randomly selected characters forming a long string of characters which are hard to predict, and every service _should_ have an individual password. Thus, some of the challenges faced by the  traditional account are that users do not choose long, random characters for passwords, have the same password for more than one service, as well as not changing passwords often enough. User accounts are routinely targeted by malicious users wanting to obtain personal information or control of the accounts. 

In recent years two-factor authentication, also refered to as 2FA, has become prominent, and is seen on most of the major IT services. 2FA makes use of two steps in order to authenticate the user. It does this by not merely requiring the username and password, but also a second account or application, these are usually emails, independent authentication apps, or apps owned by the service you are trying to access. An example of independent apps used by other services would be the Google Authentication app, and an example of a service owning an app could be the game service Steam. But even though 2FA has gotten more prominent it still struggles to achieve wide spread use. This might be seen as 2FA not being a suitable solution for some people. This makes for the question of whether it is possible to give this group of people a different option to secure their accounts?
